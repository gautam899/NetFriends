# How to run??
1. The first thing that we need is to create a database on MongoDB. After creating the database we need to create a ".env" file in the server folder which will store our "MONGO_URL", "PORT", and "JWT_SECRET".
2. After this we need to install all the necessary packages for this project. All the required packages can be seen from the dependencies in package.json file. This needs to be done in both server and Client.
3. Once we are ready with the packages and MongoDB running open localhost:3000. The app will allow you to login, register,upload images.
4. When logged in there are multiple features available such as:
 a. Like a post
 b. Read Comments
 c. Light to Dark mode and vice-versa
 d. Logout
 e. Make a post yourself by writing some text and uploading some image.
 f. Add or remove someone from your friend List.
 g. Vist some user's profile page.
